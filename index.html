                <h2>The Origin of the Chihuahua</h2>
                <p>There are many theories on the origins of the Chihuahua breed, with some being more far-fetched than others. 
                    These theories include that the Chihuahua is a descendant of ancient dogs from Mexico, that the Chihuahua is a 
                    more recent breed that was developed from European dogs after Europeans came to the Americas, and even the more 
                    far-fetched theory that the Chihuahua is not a dog at all, but a species more closely related to the fennec fox, 
                    which is a very small fox native to the Northern portion of the African continent. They are known for their very 
                    large ears compared to their small bodies.</P>

                <p>Until recently, the primary evidence for the origin of Chihuahuas was the archaeological remains of ancient Mesoamerican cultures. 
                    One of the cultures predating the Aztecs, called the Toltecs, created paintings, sculptures and toys of their dog called the 
                    Techichi. These artworks of the techichi look similar to the modern day Chihuahua. According to the 
                    <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/chihuahua/detail/#history">AKC</a>, it is believed that the modern Chihuahua is the 
                    result of crossbreeding the Techihi and the &quot;the small hairless dog brought from Asia over the land bridge.&quot;</p>

                <p>In 2013 the study, <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1766/20131142.full">Pre-Columbian origins of Native 
                    American dog breeds[...],</a> was published. This article used DNA testing to pinpoint the true origin of American dog breeds, 
                    including the Chihuahua. The researchers of the study found that the &quot;Mexican breed Chihuahua shared a [group of genes] 
                    uniquely with Mexican pre-Columbian samples, showing genetic continuity over time and geographical region and corroborating the 
                    Mexican origins of the Chihuahua.&quot; There is now DNA evidence that the Chihuahua descended from ancient Mexican dogs. </p>
                
                <p>The Chihuahua was officially recognized by the AKC in 1904, and over the course of about a century from that point on the Chihuahua has 
                    become a household breed. The <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/chihuahua/">AKC</a> reports that the it is the 29th most popular breed
                    in the U.S. The Chihuahua has also been the mascot for Taco Bell, and appeared in movies and TV shows. But most important of all, has been a
                    loyal companion to the people that love them.</p>

            <h2>The Main Characteristics</h2>
            <p> Chihuahuas vary greatly in appearance; however, most kennel clubs consider all Chihuahuas as only one breed, while some kennel clubs consider 
                the long haired and smooth coats to be different breeds. Officially, Chihuahuas can only weigh 2-6 pounds according to breed standards, but
                non-show dog Chihuahuas can weigh as much as 15 pounds, and maybe even more.</p>

            <h3>Coat Types</h3>
            <div id="longCoatContainer" class="topicContainer">
                <img class="thumbnail" src="images/longhair_16-9.jpg" alt="Long Hair Chihuahua"/>
                <h4>Long hair</h4>
                <p >Long hair chihuahuas have longer hair than smooth coats, although the length of the longer coat can vary. Their hair texture is less
                    coarse and can be wavy. Long coats require more grooming since they need to be brushed regularly to prevent their coat from becoming
                    matted.</p>  
            </div>
            <div id="shortCoatContainer" class="topicContainer">
                <img class="thumbnail" src="images/chihuahua-981188_640.jpg" alt="Smooth Coat Chihuahua"/>
                <h4>Smoooth Coat</h4>
                <p>Smooth coat Chihuahuas have short hair. Their coat tends to be shinier and rougher to the touch than long hair Chihuahuas. This coat
                    needs minimal grooming, because their coat will not become matted. Smooth coats are more commonly seen in movie and TV media than long
                    hair chihuahuas.</p>   
                </div>
            <h3>Head Types</h3>
            <div id="appleHeadContainer" class="topicContainer">
                <img class="thumbnail" src="images/chihuahuas-530262_16-9.jpg" alt="Apple Head Chihauhuas"/>
                <h4>Apple Head</h4>
                <p>Apple head chihuahuas have a larger more &quot;apple-like&quot; head than the deer face chihuahua. Their snouts are also shorter. 
                They also tend to have larger eyes. Technically, the AKC does not the recognize different head types, however, only the 
                Chihuahua&rsquo;s with an apple head meet the breed standard.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="deerFaceContainer" class="topicContainer">
                <img class="thumbnail" src="images/dog-781787_640.jpg" alt="Deer Face Chihuahua"/>

                <h4>Deer Face</h4>
                <p>The deer face chihuahua has a face that is more &quot;deer-like.&quot; Their snout is longer and their head is narrower. They also can
                    have larger ears. Even though deer faces are not accepted by the AKC, they are more commonly featured in movies and TV; for example, 
                    the taco bell chihuahua and the chihuahua in Reese Witherspoon&rsquo;s move, legally blonde, were both deer face Chihuahuas.</p>

                <h2>Chihuahuas Are Not Only Lap Dogs</h2>
                <p id="tagline">...although that is one of their favorite pastimes.</p>
                <p>Even though Chihuahuas are one of the smallest breeds in the world and are known for loving to sleep in their owners&rsquo; laps, Chihuahuas
                    can also have an adventurous side. Chihuahuas are easily trainable and can have the endurance to walk for miles (although the distance will
                    need to be gradually increased if the Chihuahua is not used to physical activity). </p>


                <h3>Agility</h3>
                <p>Dog agility involves a dog and its handler navigating their way across an obstacle course. Most commonly this will be a large breed dog, such
                    as the Border Collie.These obstacles include jumping over &quot;Jumps&quot; of varying heights, running through tunnels, and running up and
                    down ramps. The handler trains the dog to recognize cues that instruct the dog on which obstacle to tackle next. Chihuahuas can be trained to
                    complete these obstacle courses like large dogs, although the Jumps will have to be smaller. </p>


                <h3>Hiking</h3>
                <p>Chihuahuas can be great hiking companions. Some Chihuahuas are very brave and love exploring new terrains and smells. Even though 
                    hiking with a dog usually involves a large dog, hiking with a small dog, like a Chihuahua, has its own advantages. For example, 
                    small dogs require less water and food, which means less supplies to carry, and a small dog can simply be carried in a backpack or 
                    in its owner&rsquo;s arms when it is tired or if it gets injured. The video, <a href="https://youtu.be/WoaT1-KBGEc">&quot;Peanut and
                    Snowflake Chihuahua hike to Morning Glory Bridge, Moab Utah,&quot;</a> features two Chihuahuas hiking through dry and rocky terrain as 
                    well as over a small stream. </p>
